# IPL 2023 Auction Data Exploration

This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the IPL (Indian Premier League) 2023 auction data. Using Python and various data analysis libraries, the notebook dives into the auction data to uncover insights on player selections, teams’ budget distributions, and the characteristics of players across different categories.

## Project Overview

The IPL auction is an event where cricket teams bid on players to build their rosters for the season. This analysis explores trends in player selections, team compositions, and financial decisions made during the IPL 2023 auction.

This repository contains:
- **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**: Handling missing values, data formatting, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Uncovering patterns in teams’ budgets, player pricing, and various characteristics of players (e.g., nationality, role).
- **Visualization**: Data visualizations are used to illustrate trends in player acquisition, team spending, and player statistics.

## Files in This Repository

- `IPL_data_Exploration.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook file with the full exploratory data analysis.
- `iplauction2023.csv`: A CSV file containing IPL auction data for the 2023 season, including player details, teams, and bid prices.

## Requirements

This project requires the following Python libraries to be installed:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For statistical data visualization, enhancing Matplotlib’s capabilities.
- **jupyter**: To run the notebook interactively.
